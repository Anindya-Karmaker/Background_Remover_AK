## Getting Started (Running from Release)

Please [download](https://github.com/Anindya-Karmaker/Background_Remover_AK/releases/tag/Background_Remover_v1.0_MACOS(APPLE_SILICON)) the Background Remover.zip from the MacOS release (compiled on Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Pro), extract the .app file and copy it to Applications folder before running it. If you get any error or the program quits, please look at **Fix macOS Gatekeeper Issue**

Currently working on a Windows Release!


## Getting Started (Running from Source Code)

Follow these steps to run the application directly using Python.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org).

### 2. Get the Code and Requirements File

First, download the project files, especially `BACKGROUND_REMOVER_AK.py` and the new `requirements.txt` file.

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in your project folder
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Requirements

With your virtual environment active, install all the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python BACKGROUND_REMOVER_AK.py
```

> **First-Time Run Note:** The first time you use the background removal feature, the program will download the required AI models (several hundred MB). This may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection. Subsequent runs will be instant.

## Creating a Standalone Application (Optional)

If you want to compile the script into a single `.exe` (Windows) or `.app` (macOS) file that doesn't require a Python installation, follow these instructions.

### 1. Install PyInstaller

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Download the Models (Crucial Step)

Before compiling, you **must** run the script at least once (`python BACKGROUND_REMOVER_AK.py`) and click **Download/check all models** to ensure the `rembg` models are downloaded to your user directory. PyInstaller needs these files to bundle them into your application.

### 3. Compile the Application

#### For Windows

1.  Please download all files including `assets` sub-folder, `build_windows.spec` and `runtime_hook.py`file in the same directory as your Python script.
2.  Run the PyInstaller command from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller build_windows.spec
    ```
3.  The final application will be in the `dist` folder as `Background Remover.exe`.

#### For macOS

1.  Please download all files including `assets` sub-folder, `build_windows.spec` and `runtime_hook.py`file in the same directory as your Python script.
2.  Run the PyInstaller command from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller build_macos.spec
    ```
3.  The final application will be in the `dist` folder as `Background Remover.app`.
4.  **Fix macOS Gatekeeper Issue**: To run the app, you may need to run this command first in the terminal (Only try if it does not work) :
    ```bash
    xattr -cr "dist/Background Remover.app"
    ```
    OR
    
    ```bash
    xattr -cr "'/Applications/Background Remover.app'"
    ```
